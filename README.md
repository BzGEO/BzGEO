My professional work blends *Earth observation* üõ∞Ô∏è and *data science* üíª. While I've been dabbling in scientific coding for roughly a decade, starting with [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Python](https://www.python.org/) in 2015, and moving to JavaScript for cloud computing with [Google Earth Engine üåé (GEE)](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) in 2017, I have been working professionally with Earth Observation (EO) and geospatial data since mid-2004. Over the years, I have applied EO and geospatial science specifically in the areas of land cover change detection, ecosystem monitoring, disaster response, and integrated water resource management, and I have supported the [SERVIR](https://science.nasa.gov/category/missions/servir/) program for the better part of the past twenty years. Most of the GitHub repos I am hosting here are hence linked to my work with SERVIR.

I currently serve as a Principal Research Scientist with the [Lab for Applied Science](https://www.uah.edu/essc/laboratory-for-applied-science) within the [Earth System Science Center](https://www.uah.edu/essc) of the [University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH](https://www.uah.edu), and I am also an affiliate member of UAH's graduate faculty. I am a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/profile/u/bzgeo) for Earth Engine. I am also an [Early Adopter](https://pace.oceansciences.org/people_ea.htm?id=127) for NASA's [PACE](https://pace.oceansciences.org/) hyperspectral mission. In terms of my educational background, I have a double Ph.D. in forest ecology from AgroParisTech (France) and Technische Universit√§t Dresden (Germany) [2016], a master's degree in forest resources from the University of Washington [2004], and an undergraduate degree in biology from Loyola University Maryland [2001]. If you're so inclined, you can check out the [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHlMsHHXU74) of my Dec. 2016 doctoral defense, which combined the mapping of forest types with Earth observation big data. üòâ
