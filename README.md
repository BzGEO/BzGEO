My professional work blends *Earth observation (EO)* üõ∞Ô∏è and *data science* üíª. While I've been dabbling in scientific coding üë®‚Äçüíª for roughly a decade, starting with [![R badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-R-276DC3?style=flat-square&logo=R&logoColor=white
)](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [![Py badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?style=flat-square&logo=Python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org/) in 2015, and moving to JavaScript for cloud computing with [Google Earth Engine üåé (GEE)](https://code.earthengine.google.com/) in 2017, I have been working professionally with EO and geospatial üó∫Ô∏è data since mid-2004. Over the years, I have applied EO and geospatial science specifically in the areas of land cover change detection, ecosystem monitoring, disaster response, and integrated water resource management, and I have supported the [SERVIR](https://science.nasa.gov/category/missions/servir/) program for the better part of the past twenty years. Most of the GitHub repos I am hosting ‚¨áÔ∏è are hence linked to [my work with SERVIR](https://www.nasa.gov/image-article/scientist-emil-cherrington/). I have worked with multispectral, thermal, hyperspectral, and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, and I was one of the editors of the 2019 [SERVIR SAR Handbook üìî](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/learn/earth-observation-data-basics/sar-handbook).

I currently serve as a Principal Research Scientist üë®‚Äçüî¨ with the [Lab for Applied Science üî¨](https://www.uah.edu/essc/laboratory-for-applied-science) within the [Earth System Science Center](https://www.uah.edu/essc) of the [University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH)](https://www.uah.edu), and I am also an affiliate member of UAH's [graduate](https://www.uah.edu/graduate/programs) faculty. I am a [Google Developer Expert](https://developers.google.com/profile/u/bzgeo) for Earth Engine. I am also an [Early Adopter](https://pace.oceansciences.org/people_ea.htm?id=127) for NASA's [PACE](https://pace.oceansciences.org/) hyperspectral üõ∞Ô∏è mission. In terms of my educational background üë®‚Äçüéì, I have a double Ph.D. in forest ecology from [AgroParisTech](https://www.agroparistech.fr/en) (France) and [Technische Universit√§t Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/?set_language=en) (Germany) [2016], a master's degree in forest resources from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/) [2004], and an undergraduate degree in biology from [Loyola University Maryland](https://www.loyola.edu/) [2001]. If you're so inclined, you can check out the [recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHlMsHHXU74) of my Dec. 2016 [doctoral dissertation](https://theses.hal.science/tel-01486533/) defense, which combined the mapping of forest types with Earth observation big data (i.e., geospatial machine learning, [#GeoML](https://bit.ly/geoml)). üòâ
